## Table

```
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
The outer pipes (|) are optional,
and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily.
You can also use inline Markdown.
